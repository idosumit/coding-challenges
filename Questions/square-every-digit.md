## Question

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because $9^2$ is 81 and $1^2$ is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because $7^2$ is 49, $6^2$ is 36, and $5^2$ is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.
